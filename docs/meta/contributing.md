The Flamingo roadmap is
[available on Github](https://github.com/flamingo-lang/flamingo/projects/1)!

There are lots of fun, hard problems to solve around the language itself, but
the best way to contribute at the moment is to think of use cases!
Flamingo enables a new kind of rapid prototyping combined with
formal verification, and that's novel combination - one that might
even seem like an oxymoron at first. If you come up with a super
cool use case, post it as an issue on Github!
