Implementing [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) is a rite of passage for every
aspiring web technology, and Flamingo is no exception! In the coming sections,
we'll walk through an implementation of TodoMVC that using React and Flamingo.

TodoMVC has a [complete specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md#functionality).
This is the ideal scenario for Flamingo development, since translating the rules
in the spec into a signature and axioms will be easy. (A complete informal
specification is really the ideal scenario for _any_ project, but Flamingo makes
it particularly nice).
