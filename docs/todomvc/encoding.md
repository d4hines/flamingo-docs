Our journey to organization and productivity begins with encoding
the logic. Be sure to play with the TodoMVC app and check out the
[spec](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md#functionality)
to get a feel for the domain (after all, you can't program what you don't understand).

When you're ready, check out the
[annotated ALM encoding in the Repl](https://repl.it/@d4hines/flamingo-todomvc#src/logic.ts).
(Forgive the lack of syntax-highlighting - we'll get there soon).

In the next section, we'll start bringing it all to life with
Flamingos' hook API!
